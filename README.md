## Why Use this Library?
The JekyllUp library makes development of JekyllUp themes easier. Jekyll themes are a very important part of using the Jekyll for website development. We strongly support Jekyll themes that take advantage of technologies such as Gulp, Webpack, Browsersync, and others. This library aims to add functionality to themes developed using these technologies.
